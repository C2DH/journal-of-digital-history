  "abstract": "This paper proposes a new model for the problem of estimating the mean of the two-dimensional vectors of a matrix.\n\nThe two-dimensional matrix is a matrix that consists of a set of elements that are not in the matrix. The two-dimensional matrix is an efficient way of computing the mean of the two-dimensional vectors of this matrix. The main contribution of this paper is the incorporation of the sum and difference of the mean of the two-dimensional vectors by means of a fast and accurate method called the fast sum method. To demonstrate the method our results are obtained and we also validate the method on three well understood datasets.",
